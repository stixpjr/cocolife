Conway's Game of Life for the Tandy Color Computer (CoCo)

This is a m6809 assmebly implementation of Conway's Game of Life[1] for the
Tandy Color Computer. I've written several implementations of this cellular
automaton, even one for a Pebble watch. All of these went through a
laborious loop for each and every pixel, which is fine on a reasonably
powerful CPU, but terribly slow on a 895kHz m6809. I then found, by accident,
a diagram[2] describing a way of using lookup tables to determine the next
iteration one full byte at a time, and set out to implement code based on that
diagram. This is the result.

Note: I also found a 6502 implementation[3], but haven't studied it closely.

There are 3 separate binaries, for different graphics modes (resolutions).
Obviously, given the algorithm, this only works with 1-bit per pixel modes:
- lifeg6r: 256x192, runs at about 0.25Hz on a real CoCo 1.
- lifeg2r: 128x96, runs at about 1Hz on a real CoCo 1.
- lifeg1r: 128x64, runs at about 1.5Hz on a real CoCo 1, but looks weird with
  non-square pixels.

Each implements a "toroidal" grid, with left-right and top-bottom wrapping.
Initial map is generated by a random fill using a fast 8-bit pseudorandom
number generator[4]. If the code detects a static or subtly altering pattern,
it will automatically reset with a random fill. The keyboard is polled at the
end of each iteration, and the Break key exits.

7 256 byte lookup tables are used in all, 6 referenced by the diagram, and an
additional "popcnt" one to count set pixels to determine changed pixel deltas.
Originally, I generated these tables in BASIC which wrote files to include
into the assembly, but then later switched to generating these in assembly
directly on program start.

The code may be assembled with lwasm[5], but also cleanly assembles with
EDTASM - meeting one of my original goals. The included Makefile should create
a disk image file containing EDTASM, all assembly source files, and the 3 BIN
programs, assuming lwasm from lwtools and imgtool from Mame are installed.
A short Perl script is used to add/remove line numbers and change line endings
for ease of editing on Unix-like OSes.
